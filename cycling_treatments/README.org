* Introduction
A request was submitted to me that the researchers want to
/cycle treatments/ during the experiment based on the the order of participants joining the experiment.

Simply put, assuming 4 treatments in total, we give out the room link to the participants
and the first one clicking the link will be in treatment 1, second in treatment 2, third in treatment 3 and fourth in treatment 4.
The fifth participant clicking the link will be in treatment 1 again and the cycling continues.

This is to help us get roughly the same number of observations for each treatment in one go.
